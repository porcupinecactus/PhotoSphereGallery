# PhotoSphereGallery

This is an example implementation of Jeremy Heleine's Photo-Sphere-Viewer to work for an easy to manage click and view gallery. 

This is a demonstration of my ability to work with and improvise using an externally created library.

Jeremy's Project can be found here https://github.com/JeremyHeleine/Photo-Sphere-Viewer

I will be providing a tutorial of how to create this example on my Design blog.

To add photosphere simply copy existing html tags and change the source file path to your photosphere.

This project will not work by simply opening the HTML file in your browser. 

Steps to make it work(node server):
1. navigate in the termial to the forked folder.
2. use a node server(you'll need to have a node server setup for it to work) command: http-server -c-1
3. open the localhost:8080
